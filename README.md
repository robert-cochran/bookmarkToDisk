bookmark-to-disk

about

    plugin that sends the browsers currently active tab url to disk to save for
    later. 

    code also exists to send url via a rest call to a local server to then be
    written to disk, but i didn't want to hastle around with starting up a
    server everytime i wanted to save some hn links. turns out browsers dont
    make it easy to write to disk without some form of user engagement to
    prevent malware (nanny state).
